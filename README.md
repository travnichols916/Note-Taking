# Note-Taking

## Description

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js. Express is designed for building web applications and APIs. This challenge gave me a better understanding of routes and to GET the knowledge necessary for understanding more of the backend. The POST and GET routes were used to store information databases and to deploy the front end on Heroku.

## Installation


A starter code was provided and was used for the Front End side and the challenge was to use the application db.json file on the back end to store and retrieve notes using the FS module. The HTML routes were creating using GET to return the NOTES.HTML and GET * to return the index.html file on the front end. API Routes were creating using GET and POST "/api/notes" and used db.json to return the saved notes. The UUID package was used to create a unique ID (Which i assume is needed for pulling the deletion of notes.)


## Usage

Screenshots included were a GET Router function, a GET POST Function and Heroku port in public->assets->images folder.
